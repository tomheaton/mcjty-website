# McJty Website - Redirector

This is the redirector for the McJty website, which is used to redirect requests from the old wiki links to the new website.

This website is built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), a React framework for building server-side rendered applications.

## Installation

To install dependencies:

```shell
pnpm install
```

## Local Development

To start a local development server:

```shell
pnpm dev
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window.
Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

## Build and Start

To build the website:

```shell
pnpm build
```

Then to start the website:

```shell
pnpm start
```

## Notes

The old wiki links looks like `https://wiki.mcjty.eu/modding/index.php?title=Main_Page`.
