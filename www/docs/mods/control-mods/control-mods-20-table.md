# Table of commands (1.20 and 1.21)

In this section all possible conditions are explained.
Some conditions are not usable in all rules.
This will be mentioned here.
Whenever a position is tested in a rule the given position depends on the rule.
For mob spawns this will be the position where the mob will spawn.
For block break events this will be the position of the broken block.
For player effects this is the position of the block on which the player is standing.

Possible types:
* `S`: a string
* `B`: a boolean (true/false)
* `I`: an integer
* `F`: floating point number
* `E`: is a string describing a numeric expression (see above for information on those)
* `[<type>]`: a list of type (for example, `[S]` is a list of strings)
* `JSON`: a JSON in a specific format explained elsewhere
