# 1.19.3

## Introduction

1.19.3 is very different from 1.19.2. That's why this has its own chapter.

### Porting Notes

Random notes and things that were encountered during porting of various McJty mods:

#### Math
Many things in `com.mojang.math` are gone. Including `Matrix4f` and `Vector3f`. Use the `org.joml` variants instead. Some things have moved to the `com.mojang.math.Axis` class

#### Creative tabs
The way to put items in creative tabs and also how to make creative tabs has changed
completely. Forge added an event for this called `CreativeModeTabEvent.Register` which
you add to the mod event bus. Here is an example:

```java
    private void registerTabs(CreativeModeTabEvent.Register event) {
        tabProbe = event.registerCreativeModeTab(new ResourceLocation(TheOneProbe.MODID, "probe"), builder -> builder
                .icon(() -> new ItemStack(ModItems.PROBE))
                .displayItems((featureFlags, output, hasOp) -> {
                    output.accept(ModItems.YOUR_ITEM.get());
                    ...
                })
        );
    }
```

#### Recipes

`AbstractRecipeAdaptor` needs an extra `category()` override.


All recipe types extending `CraftingRecipe` need a new parameter `CraftingBookCategory`.
All avaiable variants are found in the `CraftingBookCategory` class.

#### Registries

There have been many changes related to registries. For example:

```java
        dim = ResourceKey.create(Registry.DIMENSION_REGISTRY, buf.readResourceLocation());
```

should become:

```java
        dim = ResourceKey.create(Registries.DIMENSION, buf.readResourceLocation());
```
