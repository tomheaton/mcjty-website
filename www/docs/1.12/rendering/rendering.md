# Rendering

In the earlier tutorials you saw how to make a basic block and item, but it looked very ugly.
In this chapter we will demonstrate various techniques available to you for making your items and blocks look nice.

The official Forge documentation has a lot of detailed information on models so beyond the examples given in this chapter be sure to read that too: https://mcforge.readthedocs.io/en/1.12.x/models/introduction/
