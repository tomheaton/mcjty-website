# Tile Entities

If you want to add extra data to your block (more than what you can fit in the 4 bits of metadata) or you want to add some kind of logic to the block (i.e. it is a machine or other device) then you need a tile entity.
In this chapter we show a few example tile entities.

More in-depth information on tile entities can be found at the official forge documentation: https://mcforge.readthedocs.io/en/1.12.x/tileentities/tileentity/
