# Links

Here are links to other sites that contain useful information related to modding on Minecraft:

* [Many examples in code form. Easy to use as a start for your own blocks and items](https://github.com/TheGreyGhost/MinecraftByExample)
* [The official Forge documentation. Very well written and good explanation on various subjects](https://mcforge.readthedocs.org/en/1.12.x/)
* [Another official wiki with forge documentation. Not up-to-date](https://www.minecraftforge.net/wiki/Main_Page)
